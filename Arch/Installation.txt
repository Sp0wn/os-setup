1. Select and load keyboard layout:

# The keyboard layouts are stored in the keymaps directory
# It is divided first in layouts and then languages
# Then load with loadkeys and the name of the file

ls /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/**/*.map.gz
loadkeys [layout]

2. Verify boot mode:

# Try to list the efivars directory
# If there is no output, then is BIOS

ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars

3. Connect to the internet:

# First we check that our NIC is enabled
# If not we enable it
# If is it wifi then we authenticate
# For open/WEP networks we use the wireless tools
# For WPA/WPA2 networks we use wpa supplicant
# An ip address is needed to be configured
# Then we verify the connection

ip link
ip link set [interface] up
iwlist [interface] scan

iwconfig [interface] essid [SSID] key s:[PASSWORD]

wpa_passphrase [SSID] [PASSWORD] > /etc/wifi
wpa_supplicant -B -i [interface] -c /etc/wifi

dhclient

ping 8.8.8.8

4. Update system clock:

# System clock can be sync with timedatectl

timedatectl set-ntp true
timedatectl status

5. Partition the disk:

# BIOS systems will use DOS partition tables
# BIOS systems will need to set a boot flag on root
# UEFI systems will use GPT partition tables
# UEFI systems will need an EFI file
# SWAP space can be added if needed
# / partition goes in /mnt, it's a Linux type
# SWAP parition must be enabled, it's a Linux swap type
# /efi file goes in /mnt/efi, it's a EFI system type
# /home partittion can be mounted in a custom space

fdisk -l
fdisk [device]

6. Format the partitions:

# Linux file system partitions usually have ext4
# Swap partitions must be initialized

mkfs.ext4 /dev/[root]
mkswap /dev/[swap]

7. Mount the partitions:

# All partitions must be mounted in their directories
# Swap volume must be enabled

mount /dev/[roo]t /mnt
swapon /dev/[swap] 

8. Select the mirrors:

# Reflectors can be updated if needed

nano /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

9. Install essential packages:

# The base package, a Linux kernel and firmware for common hardware
# Install file system utilites like ntfs-3g for NTFS file
# Install networking software and if needed a dhcp client
# Install text editors like nano, vi or vim
# If needed install documentation like man and info pages
# If using UEFI then install efibootmgr
# If dual booting then install os-prober

pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware networkmanager nano grub sudo

10. Generate fstab:

# Generate file system table to save partition information

genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

11. Chroot:

# Change root to enter to the installed system

arch-chroot /mnt

12. Set time zone:

# Select and configure the time zone
# Time zones are saved in the /usr/share/zoneinfo
# Then it is divided into region and city
# And after located the file we make a link to /etc/localtime
# After that run hwclock to make /etc/adjtime

ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/[region]/[city] /etc/localtime
hwclock --systohc

13. Make locales:

# For making all the system locales we need to edit some configuration
# First edit the /etc/locale.gen and uncomment locales needed
# Then set the LANG variable and KEYMAP variable

nano /etc/locale.gen
locale-gen
echo "LANG=[LANG]" > /etc/locale.conf
echo "KEYMAP=[KEYMAP]" > /etc/vconsole.conf

14. Network configuration:

# First we name our host with the hostname file
# Then we add entries for our hosts resolution file

echo "[HOSTNAME]" > /etc/hostname
nano /etc/hosts

15. Set root pass:

# We configure a password for our root user

passwd

16. Bootloader:

# We install and configure our bootloader

grub-install /dev/[disk]

grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/efi/ --bootloader-id=GRUB

grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
