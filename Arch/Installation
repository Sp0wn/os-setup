# Try to list the efivars directory
# If there is no output, then is BIOS

3. Connect to the internet:

# First we check that our NIC is enabled
# If not we enable it
# If is it wifi then we authenticate
# For open/WEP networks we use the wireless tools
# For WPA/WPA2 networks we use wpa supplicant
# An ip address is needed to be configured
# Then we verify the connection

ip link
ip link set [interface] up
iwlist [interface] scan

iwconfig [interface] essid [SSID] key s:[PASSWORD]

wpa_passphrase [SSID] [PASSWORD] > /etc/wifi
wpa_supplicant -B -i [interface] -c /etc/wifi

dhclient
